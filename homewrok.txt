The main steps needed to identify and clarify the particular risks inherent in a project: Desktop analysis (carry out) to supplement brainstorming session, by: • Identifying further risks and mitigation options • Researching similar projects undertaken by the sponsor or others in the past (including overseas) • Obtaining the considered opinion of experts who are familiar with the details of the project and outline plans for financing it Risk matrix / register • The rows in a risk matrix represent the stages of the project at which the risk arises, the columns represent the causes (or types) of risk. • Risk register sets out identified risks, with cross references to other risks where there is interdependency High level preliminary analysis, to confirm the project does not obviously have such a high risk profile to not bother analysing further Upside potential in the project (sufficient), as well as downside risk, for it to be worth pursuing? Brainstorm session of project experts and senior internal and external people who are used to thinking strategically about the long term. • Identifying project risks, both likely and unlikely, and upside/downside • Discussing these risks and their interdependency. To assess independently, a thorough categorisation of the risks may be useful • Attempting to place a broad initial evaluation on each risk, both for frequency of occurrence and probable consequences if it does occur • Generating initial mitigation options and discussing them briefly
